      <p >
        Currently, we rank food trucks based on the number of reviews they have received. Food trucks with more reviews are ranked higher on the leaderboard.
      </p>
      <p >
        In the future, we plan to incorporate additional information and criteria for ranking food trucks, providing a more comprehensive and accurate ranking system.
