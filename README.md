## Getting Started

Before running the application, ensure you have Node.js. You can install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

Please install yarn (if you prefer to install it with npm and you don't have yarn installed already the set up script will ask if you want to install yarn with npm).

1. Run the set up script to set up project (Install dependancies, Initalize API Keys, and Start the Application).

```bash
./set_up.sh
```

The set up script will install needed dependancies using yarn, prompt you to enter API keys, and then start the application.
